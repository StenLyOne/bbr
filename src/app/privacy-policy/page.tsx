          play an embedded video from BBR Agency’s website, the video and
          associated assets will load from the domain www.youtube-nocookie.com,

          information about user activity including videos watched and
          interactions with content and ads. This information is not made
          available to BBR Agency and is instead handled in accordance with the
          YouTube privacy policy. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES: BBR Agency websites
          may contain links to websites related to the content available on BBR

          Agency. We advise that you use caution and be familiar with the
          privacy statement applicable to all websites you visit and/or engage
